# Excel Bike Sales Dashboard

Interactive Excel dashboard analysing bike sales by metrics such as: demographics, income, commute distance, and region.

## Project Overview

This project was my first step into data analysis using Excel. Starting from a dataset of bike buyers, I performed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and finally created an interactive dashboard to explore bike sales patterns across different demographics and regions.

It was important to me as it introduced me to important analysis techniques in Excel like removing duplicates to clean data, using pivot tables, and building dashboards with slicers/filters.

## Process

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, standardised data, categorised values (for example categorising middle aged as greater than 30 years of age, but less than 55), and corrected anomalous/erroneous data entries (e.g., trimming data inputted with extra spaces).  
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Used pivot tables to explore relationships (income, region, age, commute, etc.).  
- **Dashboard Creation**: Built an interactive Excel dashboard with slicers for filtering by marital status, home ownership, region, and education (this can be expanded upon).

## Dashboard Insights & Findings

- **Income Matters** – Bike purchasers had higher average incomes compared to non-purchasers, across both male and female.  
- **Age Demographics** – Middle-aged customers (30–55) were the most represented group in the dataset, contributing heavily to both purchases and non-purchases, making them a key demographic.  
- **Commute Distance** – Commute distance refers to how far customers typically travelled to work. Purchases declined as commute distance increased, suggesting bikes were less appealing to those with longer travels. 
- **Regional Trends** – North America showed the highest number of purchases, followed by Europe and the Pacific region. Interestingly, in the **Pacific region**, more people purchased a bike than did not, making it the only region where buyers outnumbered non-buyers.

## Lessons Learned

One of the most important things I learnt quickly during this project was to **always create a working copy of the original dataset**. I duplicated the raw data sheet and performed all cleaning, categorisation, and analysis on the copy.  
This ensured that:  
- I could always return to the untouched dataset if errors were made.  
- It gave me more confidence to experiment with cleaning and transformations without risk of losing the original data.
